# COSC-2030-S25-Structures

Movie Data
Write a program that creates a structure to store information.  The data stored should include the following:

Title

Director

Year Released

Running Time (in minutes)

Production Costs

Profits

Create two instances of your structure and hard code the data from two different movies.  Pass the structure to a function for output, display the information for both instances of the structure.

As a reminder, you can compile and run programs without using the "run" button.  This can be handy to run the examples.

To run the circle.cpp example, open a shell and execute these two commands:

    g++ circle.cpp -o circle
    ./circle
